{'context': 'paracrine signaling signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. these types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. in order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. one example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. a nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (figure 9.3). the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, take your hand off the stove! when the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. the neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the

year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the united states will be 60 years of age or older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. this loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. to treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. one major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. at that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. there is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve t cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the foxn1 gene with age. it is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. what does all this tell us? can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? the potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve t cells high. gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. the more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. the ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.',\n","     'qas':

to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. the two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. the major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. the dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. the spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. the trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. the auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. sound localization is made

illustrated in figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. the megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. a long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. the ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. the male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther. the filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains.',\n","     'qas': [{'question': \"What is the purpose of bright colors on a flower's petals?\",\n","

three different types of “junctions” that operate within the sympathetic system (figure 15.3). the first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). an example of this type is spinal nerve t1 that synapses with the t1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. the fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see figure 15.3a). the axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). this neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. in some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. with respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. an example of this is spinal nerve t1 that innervates the eye. the spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see figure 15.3b). the cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. for example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of t5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see figure 15.3c). collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. they are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. the three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see figure 15.2). the word celiac is derived from the latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the

it. the enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. these smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. for example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot. these kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. however, they are friendlier species of fungi. many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. for example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. in this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: • growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. the fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant. • the mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots. • the

population’s allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele a and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). in a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be a and tails be a. it is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. there might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. a coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). the frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. its effect is also greater

gametes are expelled through the mouth. planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. these forms may produce additional

{'context': 'in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in figure 40.4d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. the independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution.',\n","     'qas':

vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. a bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. an example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). an example of a multipolar neuron is a purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. a pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. most sensory neurons are

meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in figure 10.3).',\n","

consists of extremely small particles called atoms. dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. when two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. during any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 evolution of atomic theory although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 atomic structure and symbolism an atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. the nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. an amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. the number

mv, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. these channels are specific for the potassium ion. a concentration gradient acts on k+, as well. as k+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. this is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mv value of the resting membrane potential. repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mv value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mv, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the k+ channels are open. those k+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. what has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in figure 12.23. it is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. the change in the membrane voltage from -70 mv at rest to +30 mv at the end of depolarization is a 100-mv change. that can also be written as a 0.1-v change. to put that value in perspective, think about a battery. an aa battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 v, or a 9-v battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 v. the change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. in fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. a charge is

{'context': 'it is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. the message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. these features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. when you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. the more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 mhz). a child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. in all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. in spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. on gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the tacoma narrows bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. the millennium bridge in london was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. in our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. the diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. the system is critically damped and the muscular

osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. typically, 5–10 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2–8 hours and must be performed several times a

scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, ph, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and

allows their survival. the criteria for entering into the vbnc state are not completely understood. in a process called resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to “normal” life when environmental conditions improve. is the vbnc state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? in fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. it has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. if these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?

arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries. the precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin

disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. the long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like

particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. when a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in figure 33.13. neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 −8 correspondingly short lives. for example, the neutral pion π is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + − π and π , which are each other’s antiparticles. without exception, nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. for example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at cern, too. it is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. however, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. it is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. at any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not

factors influencing plant growth temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary

during cellular respiration. in terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. this means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences

amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized. the climate of these areas is warm and wet. photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (co2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. the aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. conversely, dry and

occur in the bursa that separates the acromion of the scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. in the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. at the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. at the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon

asymmetric arrangements of polar bonds, in which electrons are shared unequally between bonded atoms. polar substances and ionic compounds tend to be most soluble in water because they interact favorably with its structure. in aqueous solution, dissolved ions becomehydrated; that is, a shell of water molecules surrounds them. substances that dissolve in water can be categorized according to whether the resulting aqueous solutions conduct electricity. strong electrolytes dissociate completely into ions to produce solutions that conduct electricity well. weak electrolytes produce a

growth that become more intense as the population size increases. neither model adequately describes natural populations, but they provide points of comparison. exponential growth charles darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the english clergyman thomas malthus. malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. the early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. the best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. this division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. if 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. in another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. after the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. the important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number

belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. we now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. the primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see figure 14.23). the neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. the hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is

production model of a vehicle powered with a fuel cell, can hold 4.1 kg (just under 9 lb) of highly pressured h2 gas and has a range of 450 km (280 mi). it costs about $120,000–$140,000 to build, making the vehicle beyond the ability of most people to own. finally, it always requires more energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a fuel than can be extracted from hydrogen as a fuel. as such,

{'context': 'although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. the most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. if you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see figure 2.26b). less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. the secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see figure 2.26c). in this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. a disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see figure 2.26d). the polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. for instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. when they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. an everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. the contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. for example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). as another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. these elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.',\n","     'qas':

bonds. this leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. unlike most other substances, water expands when it freezes. water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. this can be seen on a small scale, such as the coolant in your car, or on a larger scale, such as the more moderate climates in coastal areas. the water in the oceans acts as a tremendous heat sink, which influences global weather patterns. the clouds that form above lakes and oceans originate from the evaporation of lake and ocean water.
