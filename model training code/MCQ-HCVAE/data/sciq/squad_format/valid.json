reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated with anxiety. when you are dehydrated, salivation is reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take action to quench your thirst. salivation can be stimulated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. it can even be stimulated by thinking about food. you might notice whether reading about food and salivation right now has had any effect on your production of saliva. how does the salivation process work while you are eating? food contains chemicals that stimulate taste receptors on the tongue, which send impulses to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem. these two nuclei then send back parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves, which

in a standing position. this volume is known as the end diastolic volume (edv) or preload. initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. however, blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. this increase in pressure causes blood to flow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see figure 19.27). in the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood.

with the condyle (head) of the mandible. located between these bony structures, filling the gap between the skull and mandible, is a flexible articular disc (figure 9.15). this disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle. movement at the tmj during opening and closing of the mouth involves both gliding and hinge motions of the mandible. with the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. during opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly, causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting articular tubercle. the net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and mandibular depression. the temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. this ligament spans the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial side of the mandibular ramus. dislocation of the tmj may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. in this case, the individual would not be able to close his or her mouth. temporomandibular joint disorder

would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206g reaction actually require some energy to proceed? the reason lies in the steps that take place during a chemical reaction. during chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed. for example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule are broken. since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken. however, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. a small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. this contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. for this reason, reactant molecules don\u2019t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction. free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction. whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic

several other factors influence the target cell response. for example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. this process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. when the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors. this process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones. two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. the three most common types of interaction are as follows: \u2022 the permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. for example, thyroid hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. a dietary deficiency of iodine, a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning. \u2022 the synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. in some cases, two hormones are required for an adequate response. for example, two different reproductive hormones\u2014fsh from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries\u2014are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells). \u2022 the antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. a familiar example is

bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger

the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. there is no corresponding moderator band on the left. both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the purkinje fibers (see figure 19.19, step 4). this passage takes approximately 25 ms. the purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. they extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. the purkinje fibers have a fast

capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. there are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. a viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, meaning the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. viral vaccines may also be used in active viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus. antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success. combinations of anti-hiv drugs have been

bones. the suture is frequently convoluted, forming a tight union that prevents most movement between the bones. (see figure 9.5a. ) thus, skull sutures are functionally classified as a synarthrosis, although some sutures may allow for slight movements between the cranial bones. in newborns and infants, the areas of connective tissue between the bones are much wider, especially in those areas on the top and sides of the skull that will become the sagittal, coronal, squamous, and lambdoid sutures. these broad areas of connective tissue are called fontanelles (figure 9.6). during birth, the fontanelles provide flexibility to the skull, allowing the bones to push closer together or to overlap slightly,

tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of b cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established. in the process of clonal deletion, immature b cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population. in the process of clonal anergy, however, b cells exposed

tolerance, functional, mature b cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. most protein antigens require signals from helper t cells (th2) to proceed to make antibody. when a b cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. this is yet another example of the

organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. the widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. the german chemist friedrich wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as co and co2. although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms. today, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. the value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within

reptiles, birds, and mammals. animals in the phylum chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail (figure 15.33). in certain groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development. the chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. it is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides skeletal support through the length of the body. in some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime. in vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. the notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (the spine). the dorsal hollow nerve cord is derived from ectoderm that sinks below the surface of the skin and rolls into a hollow tube during development. in chordates, it is located dorsally to the notochord. in contrast, other animal phyla possess solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. the nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system. pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx, the region just posterior to the mouth, that extend to the outside environment. in organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food from the water that enters the mouth. in fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, jaw supports. in tetrapods, the slits are further modified into components of the ear and tonsils, since there is no longer any need for gill supports in these air-breathing.", "qas": [{"question": "The

called costal breathing, requires contraction of the intercostal muscles. as the intercostal muscles relax, air passively leaves the lungs. in contrast, forced breathing, also known as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise or actions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as singing. during forced breathing, inspiration and expiration both occur due to muscle contractions. in addition to the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, other accessory muscles must also contract. during forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. during forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. this helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. in addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress the rib

kikunae ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. the taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid l-glutamate. in fact, monosodium glutamate, or msg, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. what is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami? savory substances tend to be high in protein. all odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. if a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell. and if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell. humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. a person\u2019s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.", "qas": [{"question": "If a substance does

circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. other organ systems have developed further

different kinds of pigments exist, and each has evolved to absorb only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them

there are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion. with dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. the carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. in photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. when a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat. each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum. the graph in figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of carotenoid pigment called \u03b2-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. because green is reflected or

from the same plant is used to form gametes, and eventually, the zygote. in contrast, cross-pollination\u2014or out-crossing\u2014leads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different plants. because cross-pollination allows for more genetic diversity, plants have developed many ways to avoid self-pollination. in some species, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times. these flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible. by the time pollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower. some flowers have developed physical features that prevent self-pollination. the primrose is one such flower. primroses have evolved two flower types with

several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( figure below ).", "qas": [{"question": "Almost all earthquakes occur at which place?",

and droughts are all impacts of global warming. but how does global warming actually affect the oceans? the sea, it turns out, absorbs carbon dioxide emissions. the ocean acts like a giant sponge, absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from the air. and as we add more and more carbon dioxide to air by burning fossil fuels, the ocean is absorbing it. on one level, it's done us a big favor. scientists say that we would be experiencing much more extreme climate change were it not for the ocean's ability to remove the heat-trapping gas. however, these emissions are causing the oceans to become more acidic. changing ph levels threaten entire marine food webs, from coral reefs to salmon. see http://www. kqed. org/quest/radio/acidic-seas for additional information.", "qas":
