concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. one example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. a nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (figure 9.3). the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, take your hand off the stove! when the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. the

older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. this loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. to treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. one major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. at that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. there is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve t cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the foxn1 gene with age. it is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. what does all this tell us? can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? the potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve t cells high. gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. the more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. the ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.", "qas": [{"question": "By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the united states will be 60 years of age or older. the cdc

systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. the two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. the major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. the dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. the spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. the trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. the auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. sound localization is made possible through the activity of these brain stem structures. the vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. the visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. the ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-term memory

"flowers flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk. although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. the peduncle attaches the flower to the plant. a whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud. sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. for example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. sepals and petals together form the perianth. the sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. as illustrated in figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. the megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. a long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. the ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. the male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium),

first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). an example of this type is spinal nerve t1 that synapses with the t1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. the fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see figure 15.3a). the axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). this neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. in some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. with respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. an example of this is spinal nerve t1 that innervates the eye. the spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see figure 15.3b). the cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. for example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of t5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see figure 15.3c). collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. they are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. the three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see figure 15.2). the word celiac is derived from the

resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is near menopause (the cessation of a woman’s reproductive functions). the number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause. the initiation of ovulation—the release of an oocyte from the ovary—marks the

the human foot. these kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. however, they are friendlier species of fungi. many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. for example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. in this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: • growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. the fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant. • the mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots. • the fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the

allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele a and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). in a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be a and tails be a. it is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. there might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. a coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). the frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. its effect is also greater

this threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. also, the bonds are moderately strong. there are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. there are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. how do atoms make compounds? typically they join together in such a way that they lose their identities as elements and adopt a new identity as a

molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. the free concentration of calcium ions (ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (atp) to remove it. for signaling purposes, ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. when signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic ca2+. the response to the increase in ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. for example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in ca 2+ leads to muscle contractions. another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic amp (camp). cyclic amp is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from atp (figure 9.12). the main role of camp in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called camp-dependent kinase (a-kinase). a-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: it phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. a-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target

through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in figure 40.4d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. the independent evolution of

make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. this is because some sunlight reflects off the earth and hits the moon. before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. during the crescent moon phase, the moon is less than half lit. it is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. during the gibbous moon phase, the moon is more than half lit. it is not full. the moon

structure and compaction if the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a

theory the ancient greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. when two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. during any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 evolution of atomic theory although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. chadwick discovered that the nucleus

a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. the nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. an amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number.", "qas": [{"question": "What particles ancient greeks propose that matter consists of ?", "id": "275", "answers": [{"answer_start": 126, "text":

ion. a concentration gradient acts on k+, as well. as k+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. this is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mv value of the resting membrane potential. repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mv value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mv, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the k+ channels are open. those k+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. what has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in figure 12.23. it is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. the change in the membrane voltage from -70 mv at rest to +30 mv at the end of depolarization is a 100-mv change. that can also be written as a 0.1-v change. to put that value in perspective, think about a battery. an aa battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 v, or a 9-v battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 v. the change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. in fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. a charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. a battery in your

of the resonance curves shown in figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. the message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. these features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. when you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. the more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 mhz). a child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. in all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. in spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. on gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the tacoma narrows bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. the millennium bridge in london was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. in our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. the diaphragm and chest wall

transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). so many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods: 1. conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (the matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale—we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero. ) heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. this type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in

bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. these buds then branch repeatedly, so that at about week 16, all major airway structures are present. development progresses after week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs. alveolar type i cells also begin to take shape. type ii pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small

of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. in plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. in all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. for plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. as shown in figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis).", "qas": [{"question": "In photosynthesis, what process involving carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata?", "id": "343", "answers":

dialysis, called hemodialysis, a patient’s blood is passed though a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine (also called adialysis machine). a section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes. the osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution. red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood. after being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body. dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. typically, 5–10 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2–8 hours and must be performed several times a week. although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream. a more permanent solution is a kidney transplant. cell walls are semipermeable membranes, so the osmotic pressures of the body’s fluids have important biological consequences. if solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results. consider what happens if red blood cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, meaning a solution of lower osmolarity than the liquid inside the cells. the cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst. this process is called hemolysis. if red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die. this process is called crenation. only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions

in response to progesterone, clusters of breast alveoli bud from the ducts and expand outward toward the chest wall. breast alveoli are balloon-like structures lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells, or lactocytes, that are surrounded by a net of contractile myoepithelial cells. milk is secreted from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. clusters of alveoli that drain to a common duct are called lobules; the lactating female has 12–20 lobules organized radially around the nipple. milk drains from lactiferous ducts into lactiferous sinuses that meet at 4 to 18

ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% cu by mass are considered commercially useful. after an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. for example, crystals of magnetite (fe3o4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in china during the first century bc. if a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the

be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. each amino acid is defined by a threenucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. the relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code. given the different numbers of “letters” in the mrna and protein “alphabets,” combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. using a three-nucleotide code means that there are a total of 64 (4 × 4 × 4) possible combinations; therefore, a given amino acid is encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet (figure 9.20).", "qas":

arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries. the precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. their function is critical: if all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. when the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (figure 20.6). if all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. this creates what is known as a vascular shunt. in addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the

intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. when a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in figure 33.13. neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 −8 correspondingly short lives. for example, the neutral pion π is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + − π and π , which are each other’s antiparticles. without exception, nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. for example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at cern, too. it is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. however, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. it is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. at any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. but this knowledge

telencephalon is stretched into this same c-shape. the two ventricles are in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. the interventricular foramina connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. the third ventricle is the space bounded by the medial walls of the hypothalamus and thalamus. the two thalami

the tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. the aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. the floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain). the fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord. the ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. the single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that csf can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the cns. cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called a choroid plexus. ependymal cells (one of the

tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. in the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. at the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. at the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. the olecranon forms the bony tip of the elbow,

the end of this section, you will be able to: • compare innate and learned behavior • discuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection • discuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other • give examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors • differentiate between various mating systems • describe different ways that species learn behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology. one goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. they are “hard wired” into the system. on the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are

resources. the early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. the best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. this division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. if 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. in another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. after the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. the important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is itself

stimulated muscle movement. we now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. the primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see figure 14.23). the neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. the hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation.

when exercising. however, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions. during heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and

occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. the most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. if you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see figure 2.26b). less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. the secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see figure 2.26c). in this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. a disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see figure 2.26d). the polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. for instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. when they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. an everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. the contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. for example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). as another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. these elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.", "qas": [{"question": "Illustrating how form follows function, long, slender protein strands that make up what tissue are essential for contracting and relaxing?", "id": "892",
