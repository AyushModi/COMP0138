other nerve cells or muscle cells. the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (figure 9.3). the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, take your hand off the stove! when the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. the neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.", "qas": [{"question": "Paracrine signals move by what method through the extracellular matrix?", "id": 200019, "answers": [{"answer_start": 139, "text":

year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the united states will be 60 years of age or older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. this loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. to treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. one major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35\u201345 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one\u2019s life. at that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. there is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of na\u00efve t cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the foxn1 gene with age. it is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. what does all this tell us? can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? the potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of na\u00efve t cells high. gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. the more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. the ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.", "qas":

floral bud. sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. for example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. sepals and petals together form the perianth. the sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. as illustrated in figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. the megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. a long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. the ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. the male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the

types of \u201cjunctions\u201d that operate within the sympathetic system (figure 15.3). the first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). an example of this type is spinal nerve t1 that synapses with the t1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. the fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see figure 15.3a). the axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). this neuron then projects to a target effector\u2014in this case, the trachea\u2014via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. in some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. with respect to the \u201cwiring\u201d involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. an example of this is spinal nerve t1 that innervates the eye. the spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see figure 15.3b). the cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. for example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of t5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see figure 15.3c). collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. they are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. the three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see figure 15.2). the word celiac is derived from the latin word \u201ccoelom,\u201d which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the

genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die

only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population\u2019s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele a and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). in a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be a and tails be a. it is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. there might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. a coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). the frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the effect of drift

amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in figure 40.4d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of

dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell\u2019s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the

extremely small particles called atoms. dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. when two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. during any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 evolution of atomic theory although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. thomson\u2019s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge\u2014the charge of an electron. rutherford\u2019s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 atomic structure and symbolism an atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. the nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. an amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 \u00d7 10\u221224 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. electrons are light particles with a charge of 1\u2212 and a mass of 0.00055 amu. the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (z) and is the property that defines an atom\u2019s elemental identity. the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number.", "qas": [{"question": "What particles ancient greeks propose that matter consists of ?", "id": 200228, "answers": [{"answer_start": 126, "text": "atoms"}],

the potassium ion. a concentration gradient acts on k+, as well. as k+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. this is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mv value of the resting membrane potential. repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mv value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mv, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the k+ channels are open. those k+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. what has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in figure 12.23. it is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. the change in the membrane voltage from -70 mv at rest to +30 mv at the

"it is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. the message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car\u2019s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. these features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. when you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station\u2019s broadcast (driving) frequency. the more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 mhz). a child on a swing is driven by a parent at the

the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. in all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. for plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. as shown in figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding

reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. the long polysaccharide

twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. the most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. if you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see figure 2.26b). less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. the secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein\u2019s tertiary structure (see figure 2.26c). in this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. a disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see figure 2.26d). the polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. for instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. when they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. an everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. the contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. for example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). as another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. these elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.", "qas": [{"question": "Illustrating how form follows function, long, slender protein

cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of reactants because the products of the reaction are continuously removed. unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or electrical

approximately 70% of the earth\u2019s surface is covered in water. for a small molecule, water molecules are highly attracted to one another, due to particularly strong hydrogen bonds. this leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. unlike most other substances, water expands when it freezes. water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. this can be seen on a small scale, such as the coolant in your car, or on a larger scale, such as the more moderate climates in coastal areas. the water in the oceans

inner shell intact. ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right. minor deviations from this trend can be explained in terms of particularly stable electronic configurations, called pseudo noble gas configurations, in either the parent atom or the
