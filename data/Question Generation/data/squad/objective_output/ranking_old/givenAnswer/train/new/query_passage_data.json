Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).", "cid": 200121, "qas": [{"id": 100517, "question": "What is responsible for putting information into permanent storage?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 435, "text": "database engine"}]}, {"id": 100518, "question": "What do database administrators closely monitor?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 647, "text": "storage properties and configuration setting"}]}, {"id": 100519, "question": "What is database storage?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 41, "text": "physical materialization of a database"}]}, {"id": 100520, "question": "While working, does DBMS store information in one place?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 881, "text": "several types of storage"}]}, {"id": 100521, "question": "What are huge quantities of information stored as?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1047, "text": "bits"}]}]}, {"context": "Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) is allowed to access what information in the database.

Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin.

He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”", "cid": 200846, "qas": [{"id": 103762, "question": "Which journalist considered Spectre the worst James Bond movie in three decades?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 515, "text": "Scott Mendelson"}]}, {"id": 103763, "question": "Which writer for the San Francisco Chronicle awarded Spectre with a perfect score?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1373, "text": "Mick LaSalle"}]}, {"id": 103764, "question": "What score did the writer from the Chicago Tribune give to Spectre?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2118, "text": "75"}]}, {"id": 103765, "question": "The reviewer from Variety compares Spectre to which other Bond movie?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2982, "text": "Skyfall"}]}]}, {"context": "Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, also criticised the film, saying that Spectre \"backslides on virtually every [aspect]\".

The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.", "cid": 200940, "qas": [{"id": 104297, "question": "What are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Alps"}]}, {"id": 104298, "question": "Elevations around the world that have a cold climate similar to that of the polar region have been called what?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 233, "text": "Alpine"}]}, {"id": 104299, "question": "What causes the temperature to decrease?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 241, "text": "A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere"}]}, {"id": 104300, "question": "What is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and dry south?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 631, "text": "The height of the Alps"}]}]}, {"context": "The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind.

In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response. Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization. Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates.

Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a \"day and night\" may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.", "cid": 201167, "qas": [{"id": 105329, "question": "What day is presumed the Crucifixion happened?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 110, "text": "Friday"}]}, {"id": 105330, "question": "Why do some scholars propose a Thursday is possible?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 237, "text": "a \"double sabbath\" caused by an extra Passover sabbath"}]}, {"id": 105331, "question": "Why do some other scholars argue that it happened on a Wednesday?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 442, "text": "on the grounds of the mention of \"three days and three nights\" in Matthew"}]}, {"id": 105332, "question": "How long was Jesus said to be in the tomb?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 476, "text": "three days and three nights"}]}, {"id": 105333, "question": "Was Jesus in the tomb exactly 72 hours?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 816, "text": "references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights"}]}]}, {"context": "In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.).

By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity.

According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report, and Amistad. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China.

Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.", "cid": 201316, "qas": [{"id": 106072, "question": "What was Indy's father's career?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 549, "text": "professor of medieval literature"}]}, {"id": 106073, "question": "What artifact did Indy's father focus on?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 671, "text": "the Holy Grail"}]}, {"id": 106074, "question": "What is Spielberg's most common theme?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 50, "text": "tension in parent-child relationships"}]}, {"id": 106075, "question": "Whose son disappeared in 'Minority Report'?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1183, "text": "John Anderton"}]}, {"id": 106076, "question": "Whose parents divorced in 'Catch Me If You Can'?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1664, "text": "Frank Abagnale"}]}]}, {"context": "In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films.

Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.

Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a \"telephone repeater\" analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately. The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound. Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats. Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned, but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations, the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use. A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet. This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device.

In the United States in 1894, under the Berliner Gramophone trademark, Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value, along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them.

When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated.

Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \"unbreakable\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.", "cid": 201605, "qas": [{"id": 107362, "question": "What material was used by RCA Victor for special purpose records?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 37, "text": "vinyl-based Victrolac compound"}]}, {"id": 107363, "question": "What was Metrolite and Sav-o-flex materials primarily used for?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1335, "text": "children's records"}]}, {"id": 107364, "question": "What year was the Victrolac compound released?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3, "text": "1931"}]}, {"id": 107365, "question": "What were advantages of vinyl in the 1930's?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 181, "text": "light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise"}]}, {"id": 107366, "question": "What was a downfall of ordinary 78 rpm vinyls in household house?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 402, "text": "higher cost"}]}]}, {"context": "In the 1890s, the recording formats of the earliest (toy) discs were mainly 12.5 cm (nominally five inches) in diameter; by the mid-1890s, the discs were usually 7 in (nominally 17.5 cm) in diameter. By 1910 the 10-inch (25.4 cm) record was by far the most popular standard, holding about three minutes of music or other entertainment on a side. From 1903 onwards, 12-inch records (30.5 cm) were also sold commercially, mostly of classical music or operatic selections, with four to five minutes of music per side. Victor, Brunswick and Columbia also issued 12-inch popular medleys, usually spotlighting a Broadway show score. However, other sizes did appear. Eight-inch discs with a 2-inch-diameter (51 mm) label became popular for about a decade in Britain, but they cannot be played in full on most modern record players because the tone arm cannot play far enough in toward the center without modification of the equipment.", "cid": 201606, "qas": [{"id": 107367, "question": "What was the most popular sized disc by 1910?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 212, "text": "10-inch"}]}, {"id": 107368, "question": "How long could a recording be on a 10 inch disc in the 1903?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 475, "text": "four to five minutes of music per side"}]}, {"id": 107369, "question": "How small were the earliest discs released?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 76, "text": "12.5 cm"}]}, {"id": 107370, "question": "What was one requirement issue with discs popular in Britain?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 897, "text": "modification of the equipment"}]}, {"id": 107371, "question": "Which disc could hold about three minutes of recording on either side?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 212, "text": "10-inch"}]}]}, {"context": "The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing.

Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length.

Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.\" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \"metallic soap,\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \"wax\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \"plating\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \"matrix\" or \"father.\" The \"father\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \"mother\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \"father\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \"mothers\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \"sons\". Each \"mother\" can be used to make many \"sons\" before deteriorating. The \"sons\" are then converted into \"stampers\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \"father\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \"son\" (for each side), the \"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \"two-step-process\" (as it does not entail creation of \"sons\" but does involve creation of \"mothers,\" which are used for test playing and kept as \"safeties\" for electroforming future \"sons\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \"sons\" made during a \"three-step\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \"fathers\".", "cid": 201647, "qas": [{"id": 107562, "question": "What is the two step process?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2659, "text": "\"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper"}]}, {"id": 107563, "question": "What is the limitation of the two step process?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2963, "text": "limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings"}]}, {"id": 107564, "question": "Which is preferred the two step or three step process?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3126, "text": "three-step"}]}, {"id": 107565, "question": "Which have stronger structures the father or son mold?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3105, "text": "sons"}]}, {"id": 107566, "question": "What can increase the output of a stamper mold?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3070, "text": "quality of the vinyl is high"}]}]}, {"context": "Breakage was very common in the shellac era.

Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.

Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent.

Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective, while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist. Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities. Galileo Galilei, who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua, and Martin Luther, who taught at the University of Wittenberg (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.", "cid": 201742, "qas": [{"id": 108017, "question": "What was the source of educational material in Early Modern age universities?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 46, "text": "the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages"}]}, {"id": 108018, "question": "What sources did Early Modern age universities rely on for medical curricula?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 291, "text": "Galen and Arabic scholarship"}]}, {"id": 108019, "question": "The concentration on students to live honorable lives is an example of what form of thought?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 555, "text": "Humanist"}]}, {"id": 108020, "question": "Niccolò Leoniceno was a professor of what subject?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 964, "text": "medicine"}]}, {"id": 108021, "question": "Which individual added a humanist view into the Corpus Juris?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1417, "text": "Andreas Alciatus"}]}]}, {"context": "Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive.

The Saffarid dynasty in particular was the first in a line of many dynasties to officially adopt the new language in 875 CE. Dari may have been heavily influenced by regional dialects of eastern Iran, whereas the earlier Pahlavi standard was based more on western dialects. This new prestige dialect became the basis of Standard New Persian. Medieval Iranian scholars such as Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa (8th century) and Ibn al-Nadim (10th century) associated the term \"Dari\" with the eastern province of Khorasan, while they used the term \"Pahlavi\" to describe the dialects of the northwestern areas between Isfahan and Azerbaijan, and \"Pârsi\" (\"Persian\" proper) to describe the Dialects of Fars.
