years of age or older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. this loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. to treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. one major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. at that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. there is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve t cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the foxn1 gene with age. it is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. what does all this tell us? can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? the potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve t cells high. gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. the more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. the ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be

from the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon. in the diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. this is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. the two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. the major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. the dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. the spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. the trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. the auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. sound localization is made possible through the activity of these brain stem structures. the vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. the visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. the ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-term memory

described is that commercial batteries use solids or pastes rather than solutions as reactants to maximize the electrical output per unit mass. the use of highly concentrated or solid reactants has another beneficial effect: the concentrations of the reactants and the products do not change greatly as the battery is discharged; consequently, the output voltage remains remarkably constant during the discharge process. this behavior is in contrast to that of the zn/cu cell, whose output decreases logarithmically as the reaction proceeds (figure 19.11 \"the variation of \"). when a battery

continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within the sympathetic system (figure 15.3). the first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). an example of this type is spinal nerve t1 that synapses with the t1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. the fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see figure 15.3a). the axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). this neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. in some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. with respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. an example of this is spinal nerve t1 that innervates the eye. the spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see figure 15.3b). the cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. for example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of t5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see figure 15.3c). collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. they are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. the three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see figure 15.2). the word celiac is derived from the latin word “coelom,” which

"genetic drift another way a population’s allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele a and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). in a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be a and tails be a. it is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. there might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. a coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). the frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected.", "qas": [{"question": "What phenomenon, which is most

two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in figure 40.4d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. the

approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these

theory the ancient greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. when two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. during any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 evolution of atomic theory although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 atomic structure and symbolism an atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. the nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. an amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. the sum of the numbers of protons and

moves back toward the -70 mv value of the resting membrane potential. repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mv value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mv, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the k+ channels are open. those k+ channels are slightly delayed

interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. the message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. these features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. when you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. the more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 mhz). a child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. in all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. in spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. on gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the tacoma narrows bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. the millennium bridge in london was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. in our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. the

machine). a section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes. the osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution. red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood. after being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body. dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. typically, 5–10 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2–8 hours and must be performed several times a week. although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream. a more permanent solution is a kidney transplant. cell walls are semipermeable membranes, so the osmotic pressures of the body’s fluids have important biological consequences. if solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results. consider what happens if red blood cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, meaning a solution of lower osmolarity than the liquid inside the cells. the cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst. this process is called hemolysis. if red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die. this process is called crenation. only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions that have the same osmolarity as exists inside the cells are they unaffected by negative effects of osmotic pressure. glucose solutions of about 0.31 m, or sodium

per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. this means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes. very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass. annual biomass production is directly related to the

the climate of these areas is warm and wet. photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (co2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. the aboveground biomass produces several important resources for

maintain this steady state. examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. these conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. if the blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium. the

in the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. at the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. at the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. the olecranon forms the bony tip of the elbow, and bursitis here is also known as “student’s elbow. ” bursitis can be either acute (lasting only a few days) or chronic. it can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive or prolonged pressure on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint. repeated acute episodes of bursitis can result in a chronic condition. treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is caused by an infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as

times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle). therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. however, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions. during heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring

acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. the most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. if you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see figure 2.26b). less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. the secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see figure 2.26c). in this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. a disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see figure 2.26d). the polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. for instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. when they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. an everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. the contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. for example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). as another example, bones contain long

the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. electrolysis of heavy water, d2o, yields deuterium. most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.", "qas": [{"question": "What element is the most abundant in the universe?", "id": 200746, "answers": [{"answer_start": 0,

hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. it synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland. the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control. the pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or “master gland” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in figure 37.15. it is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). the anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via
