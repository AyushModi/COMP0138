A city is also a commune – but with the city charter. Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań.

For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: \"The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all.

Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1087, "text": "article 30"}, {"answer_start": 530, "text": "TFEU article 30"}, {"answer_start": 530, "text": "TFEU article 30"}], "question": "Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade?", "id": 200180}], "generated_questions": ["who did not require action to implement claims of treaties?", "what did van gend enact in order to prevent claims to have a direct effect on the claims?", "who was the court of justice held in italy in this period?", "what are the provisions of the treaties of justice?", "who was the court of justice held in italy in this period?", "what article of the eu's law allowed that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on the trade it paid for the tariff?", "what does tfeu article stand for?", "what did van gend enact in order to prevent claims to have a direct effect on the claims?", "what is the name of the eu genag en loos v loos v loos v?", "what was the name of the article that prevented the dutch customs charging tariffs for charging tariffs?", "is it accepted that eu laws give citizens standing to bring claims to claims of claims?", "what is it called when it is not accepted by the eu?", "what did van gend enact tariffs for?", "who was the court of justice held in italy in this period?", "what is the name of the treaty that was held by the provisions of the eu law?", "what states that they are the same as the eufeu enfeu?", "what company was the tfeu article 30 prevented from being?", "what did the court of justice rule that italy had to do?", "what did the dutch court rule in regards to treaties?", "what is the name of the treaty that was directly effective to the provisions of the treaties of the treaties?", "who could recover money from the treaty of justice?", "what is the name of the eu genag en loos v loos v loos v?", "what did the article say about van genos?", "what did article 30 clearly allow?", "what did the dutch court rule in regards to treaties?", "who did not require action to implement claims of treaties?", "who held the right to express claims on citizens or companies to bring claims to claims to bring claims to claims to claims they could not do claims to bring claims or companies to claims they could not do so on their own claims?", "what did the court of justice rule that italy had to do?", "is it accepted that eu laws give citizens standing to bring claims to claims of claims?", "what did the dutch court of justice say states that the community did not have legal?", "what did van gend enact tariffs for?", "what has not all eu laws accepted?", "what is it called when it is not a member of the eu?", "who made a reference to the court of justice?", "what was the name of the vmb treaty that states that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective for the dutch?", "which eu law enforcement case was held by the eu?", "what did the court of justice rule that italy had to do?", "is it accepted that eu laws give citizens standing to bring claims to claims of claims?", "why did the court of justice rule that italy had breached a duty to the treaty?", "what article states that eu regulations states that eu regulations are the same as all member states?"], "generated_answers": ["eu or national authorities", "the provisions of the treaties", "commission v italy", "eu regulations", "commission v italy", "article 30", "directly applicable", "provisions of the treaties", "nederlandse administratie der belastingen", "30", "although it is generally accepted that eu law", "not all eu laws give citizens standing to bring claims", "imported urea -

Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.

seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 703, "text": "£1"}, {"answer_start": 703, "text": "£1"}, {"answer_start": 703, "text": "£1"}], "question": "How much capital did UK law require to start a company?", "id": 200186}], "generated_questions": ["how many danish kronem companies were required to protect creditors if they failed to insvent their minimum share capital?", "how many danish kronem companies were required to protect creditors if they failed to insvent their minimum share capital?", "what did the court of justice rule in denmark not required to comply with?", "what type of taxes did the us's court rule in denmark?", "how many danish kronems were required to protect creditors if they failed to insvent a minimum share of the company?", "who was the court of justice held in germany?", "what was the amount of the uk's limited share of the company?", "how many danish kronem companies were required to protect creditors if they failed to insvent their minimum share capital?", "what was the article that states that the uk states could not restrict a company's seat of business?", "what was the amount of the uk's limited share of the company?", "how much did the uk's limited companies cost?", "how much did the uk's limited companies cost?", "what did denmark's legislature decide to do if they were required to start insolvent creditors?", "who did the court rule infringed on?", "what did the court of justice's law require the right to be justified for?", "who was the vfeu article that states that could restrict a company's seat of business?", "what did the court of justice's law require the right to be justified for?", "how much did the uk's limited companies cost?", "how much capital did the uk's limited share capital enforce?", "what state's law was often used in the us?", "how much capital did the uk's limited share capital enforce?", "how much did the uk's limited companies cost?", "what did the court of justice's law require the right to be justified for?", "what did the court rule infringed to?", "what country's minimum minimum capital did the court of justice rule in denmark?", "what was the name of the court of justice that vv plc held infringing?", "where was the dutch court of justice held?", "who was responsible for creating the company's parent company?", "what did the court rule infringed on?", "what did the court rule infringed on?", "what was the danish krone?", "what did the court of justice decide to deny the worst standards of?", "what happened to the companies that took a uk limited to protect creditors?", "what was the danish krone?", "what did the court rule in denmark?", "how many danish kronem companies were required to protect creditors if they failed to insvent their minimum share capital?", "what did the court of justice rule in denmark not required to comply with?", "what did the court of justice's law allow the uk to have?", "what did denmark's legislature do to protect creditors if they failed to start operating?", "who did the court rule infringed on?"], "generated_answers": ["200, 000", "200, 000", "minimum share capital", "low", "had 200, 000", "uberseering bv v nordic construction gmbh", "danish krone", "200, 000", "article 49", "danish krone", "200, 000 danish krone ( around €27, 000", "200, 000 danish krone ( around €27, 000", "companies should only be started up", "german", "creditor protection", "treasury", "creditor protection", "200, 000 danish krone ( around €27, 000", "£1", "state delaware attracts most companies", "£1", "200, 000 danish krone ( around €27, 000", "creditor protection", "centros ltd v erhversus -

Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding.

Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively.

It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone.

The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest. Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts.
