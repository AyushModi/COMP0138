electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the

older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. this loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. to treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. one major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. at that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. there is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve t cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the foxn1 gene with age. it is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. what does all this tell us? can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? the potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve t cells high. gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. the more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. the ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones. telomerase is not active in adult somatic cells. adult somatic cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened. this essentially means that telomere shortening is

diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within the sympathetic system (figure 15.3). the first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). an example of this type is spinal nerve t1 that synapses with the t1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. the fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see figure 15.3a). the axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). this neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. in some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. with respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. an example of this is spinal nerve t1 that innervates the eye. the spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see figure 15.3b). the cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. for example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of t5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see figure 15.3c). collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. they are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. the three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see figure 15.2). the word celiac is derived from the latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system. 14.2 central processing sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon. in the diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. this is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. the two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. the major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. the dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. the spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. the trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. the auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. sound localization is made possible through the activity of these brain stem structures. the vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. the visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. the ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-term memory formation. the dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information.", "qas": [{"question": "Collateral ganglia controls organs in which cavity in the body?", "id": 200043, "answers": [{"answer_start": 2278, "text": "abdominal"}],

in either case, it eventually disintegrates. therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives. gametogenesis (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis. during meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell’s life cycle. meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. the production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. spermatogenesis spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery of the tube and the most mature sperm at the lumen of the tube (figure 18.14). immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. these stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm. the diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis i to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis ii to produce two cells called spermatids. the spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells. four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.", "qas": [{"question": "Oogenesis, which is gametogenesis in females, begins with what type of ste cells?", "id": 200054, "answers": [{"answer_start": 84, "text": "ovarian"}], "distractors": ["secretion", "digestive", "uterian"]}], "method1": {"generated_question": "what does the ovarian stem cells divide via?", "generated_choices": ["mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis", "ovaries", "menopause", "fetal development"]}, "method2": {"generated_question": "oogonia form oocytes in the fetal area where?", "generated_choices": ["fetal ovary", "mitosis", "mitosis", "ovaries"]}, "method3": {"generated_question": "what is another term for ovarian stem cells?", "generated_choices": ["oogonia", "spermatogonia in the testis. unlike spermatogonia, however, oogonia form primary oocytes in the fetal ovary prior to birth", "ovaries", "spermatogonia"]}}, {"context": "9.80 m/s 2 . when we say that an acceleration is 45 g 's, it is 45×9.80 m/s 2 , which is approximately 440 m/s 2 . ) while living subjects are not used any more, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with rocket sleds. in this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. we will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and the choice is not always obvious. newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition;

ocean when water evaporates. if the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. this process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. this energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. more condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher.

wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol, a steroid molecule that functions

major difference between batteries and the galvanic cells we have previously described is that commercial batteries use solids or pastes rather than solutions as reactants to maximize the electrical output per unit mass. the use of highly concentrated or solid reactants has another beneficial effect: the concentrations of the reactants and the products do not change greatly as the battery is discharged; consequently, the output voltage remains remarkably constant during the discharge process. this behavior is in contrast to that of the zn/cu cell, whose output decreases logarithmically as the reaction proceeds (figure 19.11 \"the variation of \"). when a battery consists of more than one galvanic cell, the cells are usually connected in series—that is, with the positive (+) terminal of

it. the enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. these smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. for example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot. these kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. however, they are friendlier species of fungi. many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. for example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. in this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: • growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. the fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant. • the mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots. • the fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots. • the fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree. beneficial fungi fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. they colonize most habitats on earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. they can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. with their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter that is insoluble and would not be recycled otherwise. importance to ecosystems food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content. fungi are also involved in ecologically important coevolved symbioses, both mutually beneficial and pathogenic with

fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. this fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. the endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. these nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. in skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia) intertwines with the collagen of a tendon. at the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone. the tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. in other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective

initiation of ovulation—the release of an oocyte from the ovary—marks the transition from puberty into reproductive maturity for women. from then on, throughout a woman’s reproductive years, ovulation occurs approximately once every 28 days. just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary oocyte. this initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. however, as you can see in figure 27.11, this cell division does not result in two identical cells. instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much larger than the other. this larger cell, the secondary oocyte, eventually leaves the ovary during ovulation. the smaller cell, called the first polar body, may or may not complete meiosis and produce second

frequencies can change is genetic drift (figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and

walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected. natural selection can change a species or even make a new species. natural processes favor

allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. in the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches,

their interactions with other atoms. this threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. also, the bonds are moderately strong. there are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. there are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. how do atoms make compounds? typically they join together in such a way that they lose their identities as elements and adopt a new identity as a compound. these joins are called chemical bonds. but how do atoms join together? ultimately, it all comes down to electrons. before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to introduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom. pure carbon can exist in different forms, depending on how its atoms are arranged. the forms include diamond, graphite,

mixes with bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. the bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic hcl, and the digestive enzymes break down the proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. digestive hormones secretin and cck are released from the small intestine to aid in digestive processes, and digestive proenzymes are released from the pancreas (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen). enterokinase, an enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. these enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell. the amino acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create new proteins. when in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. the nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. in times of starvation, amino acids can be used as an energy source and processed through the krebs cycle.", "qas": [{"question": "Digestive enzymes are released, or secreted,

jellyfish, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by tentacles bearing nematocysts. scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. the mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. in some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity. in scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. these animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate. the gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. these forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form. the life cycle (figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and

pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus. this is in contrast with the cnidarians, where only one opening is present (an incomplete digestive system). the cuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a carbohydrate-protein polymer called chitin, and forms an external “skeleton” outside the epidermis. the cuticle also lines many of the organs internally, including the pharynx and rectum. the epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytium, which is a multinucleated cell formed from the fusion of uninucleated cells. the overall morphology of these worms is cylindrical, as seen in figure 28.31. the head is radially symmetrical. a mouth opening is present at the anterior end with three or six lips as well as teeth in some species in the form of cuticle extensions. some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts. rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation. the mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. the muscles of nematodes differ from those of most animals: they have

the receptor. these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. the free concentration of calcium ions (ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (atp) to remove it. for signaling purposes, ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. when signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic ca2+. the response to the increase in ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. for example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in ca 2+ leads to muscle contractions. another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic amp (camp). cyclic amp is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from atp (figure 9.12). the main role of camp in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called camp-dependent kinase (a-kinase). a-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: it phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. a-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. differences give rise to the variation of the responses to camp in different cells. paracrine signaling signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. these types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. in order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. one example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. a nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (figure 9.3). the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, take your hand off the stove! when the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. the neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.", "qas": [{"question": "Calcium ion is an example of what kind of

solution are called solutes. in the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins—including those that transport lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. often in medicine, a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an electrical charge (an ion) is called and electrolyte. for instance, sodium ions (na+) and chloride ions (cl-) are often referred to as electrolytes. in the body, water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to another by a process called osmosis. osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. as a result, water will move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. an appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function. most chemical reactions are carried out in solutions, which are homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. in a solution, a solute (the substance present in the lesser amount) is dispersed in a solvent (the substance present in the greater amount). aqueous solutions contain water as the solvent, whereas nonaqueous solutions have solvents other than water. polar substances, such as water, contain asymmetric arrangements of polar bonds, in which electrons are shared unequally between bonded atoms. polar substances and ionic compounds tend to be most soluble in water because they interact favorably with its structure. in aqueous solution, dissolved ions becomehydrated; that is, a shell of water molecules surrounds them. substances that dissolve in water can be categorized according to whether the resulting aqueous solutions conduct electricity. strong electrolytes dissociate completely into ions to produce solutions that conduct electricity well. weak

the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow

there are very few other genes on the y chromosome, which is the smallest human chromosome. there are hundreds of genes on the much larger x chromosome. none is related to sex. traits controlled by genes on the x chromosome are called x-linked traits.. inheritance is more complex for traits in which there is codominance or incomplete dominance. traits may also be controlled by multiple alleles

calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. because u depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and

called the born–haber cycle, in which hess’s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. the

in the transmission of nerve impulses. bone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. the softer connective tissue that fills the interior of most bone is referred to as bone

chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in figure 10.3). chromosomes are coiled structures made of dna and proteins. chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. it is this coiled structure that ensures proper segregation of the chromosomes during cell division. during other phases of the cell cycle, dna is not coiled into chromosomes.

proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. when two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. during any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 evolution of atomic theory although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 atomic structure and symbolism an atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. the nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. the mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. an amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g. protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number. atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties. atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties.",

the membrane potential reaches +30 mv, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. these channels are specific for the potassium ion. a concentration gradient acts on k+, as well. as k+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. this is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mv value of the resting membrane potential. repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mv value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mv, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the k+ channels are open. those k+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. what has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in figure 12.23. it is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. the change in the membrane voltage from -70 mv at rest to +30 mv at the end of depolarization is a 100-mv change. that can also be written as a 0.1-v change. to put that value in perspective, think about a battery. an aa battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 v, or a 9-v battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 v. the change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. in fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. a charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. a battery in your remote has stored a charge that is “released” when you push a button. 26.1 | body fluids and fluid compartments by the end of this section, you will be able to: • explain the importance of water in the body • contrast the composition of the intracellular fluid with that of the extracellular fluid • explain the importance of protein channels in the movement of solutes • identify the causes and symptoms of edema the chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions. the dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes. in the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins—including those that transport lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. often in medicine, a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an electrical charge (an ion) is called and electrolyte. for instance, sodium ions (na+) and chloride ions (cl-) are often referred to as electrolytes. in the body, water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to another by a process called osmosis. osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. as a result, water will move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. an appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of

damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. the message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. these features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. when you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. the more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 mhz). a child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. in all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. in spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. on gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the tacoma narrows bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. the millennium bridge in london was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. in our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. the diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. the system is critically damped and the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient. figure 16.9 an object attached to

the bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic hcl, and the digestive enzymes break down the proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. digestive hormones secretin and cck are released from the small intestine to aid in digestive processes, and digestive proenzymes are released from the pancreas (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen). enterokinase, an enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. these enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell. the amino acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create new proteins. when in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. the nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. in times of starvation, amino

the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. in women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. during phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection

additional task of supporting the developing fetus and delivering it to the outside world. unlike its male counterpart, the female reproductive system is located primarily inside the pelvic cavity

development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about 4 weeks and continues into childhood. ectodermal tissue in the anterior portion of the head region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, which ultimately fuse with endodermal tissue of the early pharynx. at about this same time, an protrusion of endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from the foregut, producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until it forms the laryngotracheal bud. the proximal portion of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. these buds then branch repeatedly, so that at about week 16, all major airway structures are present. development progresses after week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs. alveolar type i cells also begin to take shape. type ii pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. as the fetus grows, the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is produced. beginning at about week 36 and lasting into childhood, alveolar precursors mature to become fully functional alveoli. at birth, compression of the thoracic cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be expelled. the first inhalation inflates the lungs. fetal breathing movements begin around week 20 or 21, and occur when contractions of the respiratory muscles cause the fetus. through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles. the respiratory bronchioles open up into the alveolar

contains two pumps that move blood through the pulmonary and systemic circulations. there is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. the pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. the signal for contraction begins in the wall of the right atrium. the electrochemical signal causes the two atria to contract in unison; then the signal causes the ventricles to contract. the blood from the heart

change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. if the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. this process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. this energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. more condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. these systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes. a cold front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( figure below ).

organisms. sea stars (figure 28.44), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms. to date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known. morphology and anatomy adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry. the endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins. gonads are present in each arm. in echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side. these tube feet help in attachment to the substratum. these animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system. an interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost.", "qas": [{"question":

physical contact. heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. convection is heat transfer by an intermediate substance (for example air or water). your oven (often properly called the ‘convection oven’) works by heating up the air and then the air heats up your food. radiation is the release of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing electromagnetic waves.

balloon into a vacuum, for example, the process is irreversible; the direction of airflow cannot change. because work done during the expansion of a gas depends on the opposing external pressure (w = pextδv), work done in a reversible process is always equal to or greater than work done in a corresponding irreversible process: wrev ≥ wirrev. whether a process is reversible or irreversible, δe = q

the kinetic molecular theory of gases. molecular motion, which leads to collisions between molecules and the container walls, explains pressure, and the large intermolecular distances in gases explain their high compressibility. although all gases have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature, they do not all possess the same root mean square (rms) speed (vrms). the actual values of speed and kinetic energy are not the same for all particles of a gas but are given by a boltzmann distribution, in which some molecules have higher or lower speeds (and kinetic energies) than average. diffusion is the gradual mixing of gases to form a sample of uniform composition even in the absence of mechanical agitation. in contrast,effusion is the escape of a gas from a container through a tiny opening into an evacuated space. the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass (graham’s law), a relationship that closely approximates the rate of diffusion. as a result, light gases tend to diffuse and effuse much more rapidly than heavier gases. the mean free path of a molecule is the average distance it travels between collisions.", "qas":

important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. this action causes blood to be drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop. capillary action the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action. if a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in figure 11.34, capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. the actual effect depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle θ given in the table. if θ is less than 90º , then the fluid will be raised; if θ is greater than 90º , it will be suppressed. mercury, for example, has a very large surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. when placed in a tube, the surface of a column of mercury curves downward, somewhat like a drop. the curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. the tendency of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a capillary tube. this results in a downward force in mercury and an upward force in water, as seen in figure 11.34. metarterioles and capillary beds a metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary. slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries. the precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. their function is critical: if all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. when the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (figure 20.6). if all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. this creates what is known as a vascular shunt. in addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system. although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow. this pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes in.", "qas": [{"question": "One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed

exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. north and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other.. the net force is found by subtracting the frictional force from the applied force.. when both distance and direction are considered, motion can be represented by a vector. a vector is a measurement that has

microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), to amplify selected portions of dna of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. recall that pcr can make billions of copies of a dna segment in a process called amplification. 6.4 | prokaryotic cell division by the end of this section, you will be able to: • describe the process of binary fission in prokaryotes • explain how ftsz and tubulin proteins are examples of homology prokaryotes such as bacteria propagate by binary fission. for unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. in unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals. to achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. the genomic dna must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. in bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular dna chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes. this type of cell division is called binary fission.", "qas": [{"question": "Some bacteria

almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. metallurgy is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms. metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% cu by mass are considered commercially useful. after an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. for example, crystals of magnetite (fe3o4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in china during the first century bc. if a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the fe3o4 particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals. minerals have to be removed from the ground and made into the products. all the metals we use start out as an ore. mining the ore is just the first step. next, the ore must be separated from the rest of the rock that is

although some particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. when a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in figure 33.13. neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 −8 correspondingly short lives. for example, the neutral pion π is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + − π and π , which are each other’s antiparticles. without exception, nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. for example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at cern, too. it is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. however, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. it is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. at any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. but this knowledge does raise another question—why is there such a predominance of matter and so little antimatter? possible explanations emerge later in this and the next chapter. quarks are

hypothalamus and thalamus. the two thalami touch in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. the cerebral aqueduct opens just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. the tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. the aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. the floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain). the fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord. the ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. the single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the

heart transplants show some proliferation of original cells. if researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. to date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in petri dishes (in vitro) do beat. perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will be commonplace. cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. when cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. cardiac muscle contains a great many mitochondria, which produce atp for energy. this helps the heart resist fatigue. contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary, like those of smooth muscle. cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is arranged in bundles, so it appears striated , or striped.. many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are

actually quite complex. before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. in plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. in all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. for plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a

front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( figure below ). the cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass. so the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. as the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. clouds form, and precipitation falls. if the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. temperature and pressure differences between the two air

removed from the ocean when water evaporates. if the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. this process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. this energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. more condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud

are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. this fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. the endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. these nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. in skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia) intertwines with the collagen of a tendon. at the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone. the tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. in other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective tissue between skin and bones. the broad sheet of connective tissue in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles (the “lats”) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis. every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. in addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals the fiber to contract. unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through signaling from the nervous system. skeletal muscles are attached to

from traveling up the esophagus. many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true. digestive processes the processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion, propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. the first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. there, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus. this act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. it includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (figure 23.5).

slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules. this is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. when ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. consider table salt (nacl, or sodium chloride): when nacl crystals are added to water, the molecules of nacl dissociate into na+ and cl– ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in figure 2.15.

examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors • differentiate between various mating systems • describe different ways that species learn behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology. one goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. they are “hard wired” into the system. on the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment. like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness. animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation. if genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. in other words,

and b are farther apart; a crossover is therefore more likely to occur between them. genetic drift another way a population’s allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. genetic drift is most important in small populations. drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. if one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele a and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). in a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be a and tails be a. it is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. there might be six of one

odds are no longer one half for each allele). the frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all a or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. this could take a very long time for a large population. this simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. the

almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the pct by a process called tubular reabsorption. in the loop of henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. water is also reabsorbed during this step. then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. the collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. from here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. this entire process is illustrated in figure 41.7.. kidney dialysis is the process of filtering wastes from the blood using a

influenced by the english clergyman thomas malthus. malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. the early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. the best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. this division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. if 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. in another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. after the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. the important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is itself increasing; that is, the. under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially. the growth rate increases as the population gets larger. most populations do not live under

this way are called primary, or p, waves. they are illustrated in figure below .. an earthquake is sudden ground movement. this movement is caused by the sudden release of the energy stored in rocks. an earthquake happens when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break. an earthquake’s energy is transmitted by seismic waves. each year, there are more than 150,000 earthquakes strong enough to be felt by people. an amazing 900,000 are recorded by seismometers.. waves may also deposit sediments to form sandbars and barrier islands . you can see examples of these landforms in figure

that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. increasing the diameter of the blood vessels increases the amount of blood and

sources of gamma rays include radioactive atoms, nuclear explosions, and stars. gamma rays from space are absorbed by earth’s atmosphere.. the sun gives off energy in tiny packets called photons . photons travel in waves. these waves make up electromagnetic radiation . the image below models a wave of light ( figure below ). notice the wavelength in the figure. waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.. earth is just a tiny speck in the universe. our planet is surrounded by lots of space. light travels across empty space. astronomers can study light from stars to learn about the universe. light is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum . astronomers use the light that comes to us to gather information about the universe.. almost all energy on earth comes from the sun. the sun’s energy heats the planet and the air around it. sunlight also powers photosynthesis and life on earth.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the most important source of electromagnetic waves

equation for photosynthesis is:.. photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make atp. the glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. while water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water. while photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. it is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. we breathe in

scales of reptiles prevent them from absorbing oxygen through their skin, as amphibians can. instead, reptiles breathe air only through their lungs. however, their lungs are more efficient than the lungs of amphibians, with more surface area for gas exchange. this is another important reptile adaptation for life on land. in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in figure 40.4c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in figure 40.4d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. the

six electrons are shared in a triple bond.. the n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom. the next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. the first two electrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. the remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the 2s orbital (figure

bonds are formed between atoms sharing electrons.. summary the tendency of an element to lose or gain electrons is one of the most important factors in determining the kind of compounds it forms. periodic behavior is most evident for ionization energy (i), the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom. the energy required to remove successive electrons from an atom increases steadily, with a substantial increase occurring with the removal of an electron from a filled inner shell. consequently, only valence electrons can be removed in chemical reactions, leaving the filled inner shell intact. ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper

that the \"gels\" are rectangular in shape. the gels are made of a gelatin-like material of either agarose or polyacrylamide. an electric field, with a positive charge applied at one end of the gel, and a negative charge at the other end, forces the fragments to migrate through the gel. dna molecules migrate from negative to positive charges due to the net negative charge of the phosphate groups in the dna backbone. longer molecules migrate more slowly through the gel matrix. after the separation is completed, dna fragments of different lengths can be visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for dna, such as ethidium bromide. the resulting stained gel shows bands correspond to dna molecules of different lengths, which also correspond to different molecular weights. band size is usually determined by comparison to dna ladders containing dna fragments of known length. gel electrophoresis can also be used to separate rna molecules and proteins. eukaryotic chromosomal structure and compaction if the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (figure 10.4). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in figure 10.3).", "qas": [{"question": "What analytical technique, using stained gel, can

"although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. the most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. if you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see figure 2.26b). less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. the secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see figure 2.26c). in this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. a disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see figure 2.26d). the polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. for instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. when they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. an everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. the contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. for example, the long, slender shape of

fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of reactants because the products of the reaction are continuously removed. unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or

drive an internal combustion engine that turns a generator, which is typically less than 40% efficient, and in fact, the efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40% and 60%. unfortunately, significant cost and reliability problems have hindered the wide-scale adoption of fuel cells. in practice, their use has been restricted to applications in which mass may be a significant cost factor, such as us manned space vehicles. these space vehicles use a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell that requires a continuous input of h2(g) and o2(g), as illustrated in figure 19.16 \"a hydrogen fuel

potential use in electric cars. most electric cars run on conventional batteries, which can be very heavy and expensive to replace. it is thought that fuel cells, rather than conventional batteries, might be better sources of electricity for automobiles. several current barriers to fuel cell use in electric cars include capacity, cost, and overall energy efficiency. the 2008 honda fcx, the first

making the vehicle beyond the ability of most people to own. finally, it always requires more energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a fuel than can be extracted from hydrogen as a fuel. as such, hydrogen is described as an energy carrier (like electricity) rather than an energy source (like oil and gas). this distinction points out a fundamental argument against fuel cells as a “better” power

the ways in which chemical reactions are classified. there are literally thousands of chemical reactions that take place every day in our lives. some reactions take place in the atmosphere, such as the combustion of fossil fuels. others occur in solution, like the reactions responsible for photosynthesis or the reactions that break down our food to give us energy. chemical reactions can take place in a variety of environments. reactions happen on the sea floor, in our cells, and in the upper atmosphere. as we look at chemical reactions, we notice some commonalities and trends. when we studied the elements, we saw characteristics that allowed us to categorize them by family. there are also various ways to categorize chemical reactions. some reactions produce heat, while others consume it. some reactions are spontaneous, while others are not. some reactions happen in nanoseconds, while others happen over longer spans of time. some produce electricity, some emit light, and some release gaseous products. the products of chemical reactions tell us a lot about the chemistry of the process. in the above video, we see mercury(ii) oxide decomposing into elemental mercury and

determine wavelength from the interference patterns, and knowing their frequency, he could calculate the propagation speed using the equation υ = fλ (velocity—or speed—equals frequency times wavelength). hertz was thus able to prove that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. the si unit for frequency, the hertz ( 1 hz = 1 cycle/sec ), is named in his honor. the speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa. this relationship is represented by the equation:.. the electromagnetic spectrum is the full range of wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. wavelength, frequency, and energy change continuously across the electromagnetic spectrum.. most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. for instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). the speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. in this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion.. another important measure of wave size is wavelength. wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves

removed in chemical reactions, leaving the filled inner shell intact. ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right. minor deviations from this trend can be explained in terms of particularly stable electronic configurations, called pseudo noble gas configurations, in either the parent atom or the resulting. ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in a regular array. the lattice energy (u) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; u can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. because u depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and increased hardnessbecause more thermal energy is needed to overcome the forces that hold the ions together. lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the born–haber cycle, in which hess’s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured

that allow them to use different food sources. figure below describes an example.. like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. behaviors that

birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop. this is called incubation, or brooding . in most species, parents stay together for at least the length of the breeding season. in some species, they stay together for life. by staying together, the males as well as females can incubate the eggs and later care for the hatchlings . birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental involvement.. of all vertebrate classes, birds are the most numerous, even though they evolved most recently. why have birds been so successful? the answer is flight. being able to fly opened up a whole new world to birds: the world of the air above the land and water.. birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. they are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. birds also lay amniotic eggs, and the eggs have hard, calcium carbonate shells. although birds are the most recent class of vertebrates to evolve, they are now the most numerous vertebrates on earth. why have birds been so successful? what traits allowed them to increase and diversify so rapidly?.. birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven continents. they occupy a wide range of ecological positions. raptors are carnivores; aquatic birds eat fish or water plants; and perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. some birds are pollinators that co-evolved with plants. human actions have caused the extinction of hundreds of species of birds, and some 1,200 species are threatened with extinction today.",

many things about the precambrian by studying the rocks of the cratons. rocks on different continents that are the same age point to different locations. only recent rocks point to the current north magnetic pole.. scientists discovered another way to tell the approximate age of seafloor rocks. the rocks at the mid-ocean ridge crest are nearly sediment free. the crust is also very thin there. with distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. this also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis, and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge ( figure below ). this is because the crust is new at the ridge, and so it is thin and has no sediment. the crust gets older away from the ridge crest. it has cooled and has more sediment.. there are two kinds of crust. oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. it is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). the rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm 3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor.. the lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. a few are all continental lithosphere. but most plates are made of a combination of

and energy are called by the general term radiation . only unstable nuclei emit radiation. they are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. for example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium, radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei. they are called radioactive elements. the nuclei of these elements must lose

precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and geothermal vents (figure 20.17). atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (so2), and as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (h2so4). sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout. also, as sulfur-containing rocks weather, sulfur is released into the soil. these rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates (so42-), which enter the food web by being taken up by plant roots. when these plants decompose and die, sulfur is released back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (h2s) gas. decomposers break down dead organisms and other organic wastes and release inorganic molecules back to the environment.. the chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms continuously recycle in ecosystems. they pass through biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. that’s why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles . for example, a chemical might move from organisms ( bio ) to
