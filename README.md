## Information
This repository contains the main code used for COMP0138.
The code that has been used for this project has largely been different extensions over what has already been implemented by Lee et al [[1]](#1). The actual models have been removed as they have a very large size.

The figures and scores that have been used in the dissertation can be found in the notebooks from the 'evaluation notebooks' folder.
